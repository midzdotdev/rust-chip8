# CHIP-8 Emulator in Rust

A fully functioning emulator/interpreter for the [CHIP-8 language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) used in the mid-1970s.

## What's the point?

There isn't really a point. I just see this as an opportunity for learning.

I plan in the near future to create a [Game Boy Advance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance) emulator for use on the web via [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/).
As a young child, this was my first gaming console so this is a goal very close to my :heart:.
Although a GBA may seem very simplistic, creating an emulator is by no means a small feat.

I had a good understanding of how computers work (see [von Neumann Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture)) at a theoretical level, but no practical experience.
During my research on GB and GBA, many sources recommended to first try for a CHIP-8 to 'test the waters' with emulation, so that's what I did.

## Acknowledgements

This emulator was heavily inspired by [Alexandru Ene](https://github.com/AlexEne)'s [four-part programming series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPv6awLpSB_diKBY_95ip0jL1uT7i_rJP).
